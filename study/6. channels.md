# Tokio's channel primitives

Tokio provides a number of channels, each serving a different purpose.

* mpsc: multi-producer, single-consumer channel. Many values can be sent.
* oneshot: single-producer, single consumer channel. A single value can be sent.
* broadcast: multi-producer, multi-consumer. Many values can be sent. Each receiver sees every value.
* watch: single-producer, multi-consumer. Many values can be sent, but no history is kept. Receivers only see the most recent value.
