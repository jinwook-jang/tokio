# AsyncRead and AsyncWrite
* when read() returns Ok(0), this signifies that the stream is closed
* read(): read up to 10 bytes
* read_to_end(): reads all bytes from the stream until EOF
* write(): writes a buffer into the writer, returning how many bytes were written
* write_all(): writes the entier buffer into the writer
* copy(): asynchronously copies the entire contents of a reader into a writer
* io::split: this function takes a single value and returns separate reader and writer handles-> overhead!!(Arc and Mutex)
* TcpStream::split takes a reference to the stream and returns a reader and writer handle
