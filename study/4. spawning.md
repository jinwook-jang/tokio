## Spawning
* tokio::net::TcpListener -> accpet inbound TCP sockets
* It is bound to port 6379

* Concurrency : 한 사람이 번갈아가면서 두 개의 task를 처리하는 것 (parallel은 2명이 각각 1개의 task를 동시에 하는 것)
* In fact, Tokio can run many tasks concurrently on a single thread!

```
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let handle = tokio::spawn(async {
        // Do some async work
        "return value"
    });

    // Do some other work

    let out = handle.await.unwrap();
    println!("GOT {}", out);
}
```
* tokio:spawn은 JoinHandle을 return, JoinHandle.await는 Result/Err을 return
* When you spawn a task on the Tokio runtime, its type's lifetime must be 'static. This means that the spawned task must not contain any references to data owned outside the task.
* by default, variables are not moved into async blocks.
* task::spawn(async move { will instruct the compiler to move v into the spawned task
* If a single piece of data must be accessible from more than one task concurrently, then it must be shared using synchronization primitives such as Arc.

* `static 추가 공부 필

* Tasks spawned by tokio::spawn must implement Send. This allows the Tokio runtime to move the tasks between threads while they are suspended at an .await.
