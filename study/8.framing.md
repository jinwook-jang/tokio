# Framing
* the process of taking a byte stream and converting it t oa stream of frames
* A frame is a unit of data transmitted between two peers.

## Parsing
parse_frame()
1. Ensure a full frame is buffered and find the end index of the frame -> Frame::check
2. parse the frame -> Frame::parse

* The call to flush() writes any data pending in the buffer to the socket.
