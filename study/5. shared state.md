# Shared state
## Strategies
There are a couple of different ways to share state in Tokio.

    1. Guard the shared state with a Mutex.
    2. Spawn a task to manage the state and use message passing to operate on it.

* Using Arc allows to be referenced concurrently from many tasks, potentially running on many threads
